# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## The Task

The assigment for this Challenge was to work on the backend of an application called Note Taker in order to save and retrieve data from a JSON file. The application’s front end was already been created.

## Given User Story

```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

## Mock-Up

The following video shows the functionality of the application:

![Existing notes are listed in the left-hand column with empty fields on the right-hand side for the new note’s title and text.](./Assets/11-express-homework-demo-01.png)

## Bonus - Future Development

As a part of future development, I will work on learn how to handle DELETE requests so the notes on the application can be deleted by the user with a click on the trash can button.
